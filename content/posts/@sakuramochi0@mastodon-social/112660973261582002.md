title: "@elephantarchive Hello, nice to meet you[...]"

<p><span class="h-card" translate="no"><a href="https://mastodon.social/@elephantarchive" class="u-url mention">@<span>elephantarchive</span></a></span> Hello, nice to meet you! ðŸ™‚ Since it was a while ago, I totally forgot my own code snippet and its data. But here&#39;s good news. I didn&#39;t remember the downloaded data but now I found the almost complete archive (only ep. 8 is missing) on my old HDD backup disk.</p><p>I have always thought about the importance of the archive and unfortunately, I feel like there&#39;s still not enough effort and recognition to archive content like this in Japan. So I&#39;d like to support such activity.</p>
